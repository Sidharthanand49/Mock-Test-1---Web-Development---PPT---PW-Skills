Static Position:
The default position value in CSS is static. In this position, the element follows the normal document flow and is positioned according to its place in the HTML structure.

Fixed Position:
A fixed position element is positioned relative to the browser window and remains fixed even when the page is scrolled. It does not move when the user scrolls the page.

Sticky Position:
A sticky position element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It acts like a combination of rel ative and fixed positions. It is initially positioned according 
to the normal flow, but once the user scrolls to a certain point, it becomes fixed.

Relative Position:
A relatively positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position. It can be moved using top, bottom, left, and right properties. Other elements on 
the page are not affected by a relatively positioned element.

Absolute Position:
An absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor or to the initial containing block if there is no positioned ancestor.
It is taken out of the normal document flow and can overlap other elements.
